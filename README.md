# Humanities

The work here is a mix of essays, posters, poems, and more I, or a peer and I have made in my humanities class. At Meridian Academy, the humanities class is a mix of social studies, history, and language. This class often includes work relating to the understanding and interpriting of human history, such as the entierty of colonialization, the construction of emotions, laws, writing, and how modern-day things came to be. We often delve deep into unexplored areas, accessing and uncovering stories that are hundreds of years old, none of which have been explored before. This work is often published, and has been placed in libraries all over Boston, where it has been widly distributed.
